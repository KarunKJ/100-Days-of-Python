def my_fucntion():
    #do this
    #do smthg else
    #return from my_fucntion

if we return a value from function , the value will replace the function call ,
for eg if we call output = my_function() , the returned value will be stored within the output variable

This one would always start with lowercase, and also strip non alphanumeric characters:

def camelCase(st):
    output = ''.join(x for x in st.title() if x.isalnum())
    return output[0].lower() + output[1:]

this is basically how the title() function works , it will return with the first letter capitalized

Syntax : imediately after function use """ """ use 2 double quotes

Print v return
why we use return : we do this to pass this as an input to another function

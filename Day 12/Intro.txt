Scope in Programming
Local Scope: exists only within function , only use it inside that particular function also

There is no block scope in python
we can create variables within if or while block , that namespace is accessible outside the blocks also 

how to use global variables inside functions:
for that we will have to explicitly use global keyword behind our variable name
